# ICS-4UI
This is my repository for the grade 12 computer science class
It's also where I learnt to use github
It's really not hard

also remember: if you ever commit without adding -m "message" at the end, to get out of that awkward situation, all you need to do is\n 1. pressing the escape button \n 2. type in ":wq" \n 3. press enter

Yay! : )
